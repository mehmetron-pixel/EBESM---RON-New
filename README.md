EBESM: An Information-Based Model of Consciousness and Post-Mortem Informational Continuity
Abstract
This paper introduces the Enformasyon-Temelli Bilinç ve Ölüm Sonrası Enformasyon Sürekliliği Modeli (EBESM), an original theoretical framework that conceptualizes consciousness as a high-order, self-organizing informational structure rather than a purely biological or metaphysical phenomenon. EBESM proposes that conscious experience emerges from dynamically integrated information patterns instantiated in physical systems, and that under specific theoretical conditions, informational continuity may persist beyond biological death without violating known physical laws. By synthesizing principles from information theory, neuroscience, complex systems, and computational modeling, this work aims to (i) redefine consciousness in formal informational terms, (ii) establish a non-dualistic bridge between mind and physical law, and (iii) propose testable simulations for evaluating informational persistence and transformation.

1. Introduction
The nature of consciousness remains one of the most profound unsolved problems in science and philosophy. Traditional approaches often polarize into reductive physicalism, which equates consciousness with neural activity, and dualistic or metaphysical theories, which place consciousness outside the domain of physical explanation. Both approaches face critical limitations: the former struggles with subjective experience (qualia), while the latter resists empirical validation.

EBESM is proposed as a third path. It treats consciousness as an emergent informational phenomenon grounded in physical substrates but not reducible to any single material configuration. In this view, the brain functions as a dynamic information processor, instantiating complex, recursively integrated informational structures. Consciousness arises when informational integration, differentiation, and self-referential feedback exceed a critical threshold.

Crucially, EBESM extends this framework to address the controversial
