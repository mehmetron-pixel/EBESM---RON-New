An Information-Based Model of Consciousness and Post-Mortem Informational Continuity (EBESM)

Abstract
This paper introduces the Information-Based Consciousness and Post-Mortem Informational Continuity Model (EBESM), a theoretical framework that conceptualizes consciousness as a high-order, self-organizing informational structure rather than a phenomenon strictly bound to biological substrates. EBESM integrates principles from information theory, neuroscience, complex systems, and computational modeling to propose that conscious experience emerges from dynamically integrated informational networks exhibiting persistence, recursion, and causal coherence. Furthermore, the model explores the scientifically framed hypothesis of post-mortem informational continuity, arguing that under certain physical and informational constraints, the dissolution of biological systems does not necessarily imply the complete annihilation of conscious information. EBESM does not assert metaphysical claims but formulates testable hypotheses and simulation-based approximations consistent with known physical laws.

1. Introduction
Despite significant advances in neuroscience and cognitive science, the fundamental nature of consciousness remains unresolved. Dominant models largely equate consciousness with neural activity, implicitly assuming that biological substrates are both necessary and sufficient. However, this assumption faces increasing challenges from artificial intelligence, brain emulation research, and theoretical physics, where information rather than matter is often treated as the most fundamental descriptive layer.

The Information-Based Consciousness and Post-Mortem Informational Continuity Model (EBESM) is motivated by a central question: Is consciousness fundamentally a biological phenomenon, or is it an emergent property of sufficiently complex and self-referential informational systems? EBESM proposes that consciousness arises when information reaches a specific organizational threshold characterized by integration, persistence, and recursive self-modeling. Crucially, the model examines whether such informational structures can maintain partial continuity beyond biological death without violating established physical principles.

2. Background and Related Work

2.1 Consciousness Theories
Several contemporary theories address the structure of conscious experience. Global Workspace Theory emphasizes information broadcasting across cognitive modules. Integrated Information Theory proposes that consciousness corresponds to the degree of information integration within a system. Predictive processing frameworks describe the brain as a hierarchical inference engine. While each contributes valuable insights, these models either remain biologically constrained or lack computational generality. EBESM seeks to unify these approaches under an explicitly information-centric framework.

2.2 Information as a Physical Entity
Modern physics increasingly recognizes information as a physically instantiated quantity. Landauer’s principle establishes that information processing has thermodynamic costs, while debates surrounding the black hole information paradox suggest that information is not trivially destroyed. EBESM builds on this foundation by treating consciousness as a dynamic informational process that must obey physical constraints but is not reducible to a specific material substrate.

3. The EBESM Framework

3.1 Core Assumptions
EBESM is based on five foundational assumptions. First, information primacy: consciousness emerges from information organization rather than biological matter itself. Second, dynamic integration: conscious systems exhibit high levels of causal and informational interdependence. Third, recursive self-reference: the system must be capable of modeling and updating its own internal states. Fourth, temporal persistence: conscious information must maintain continuity across time. Fifth, physical consistency: all informational processes must comply with thermodynamics, causality, and known physical laws.

3.2 Formal Representation
An informational system S can be represented as a weighted directed graph S = (N, E, W), where N denotes informational nodes, E denotes causal connections, and W represents time-dependent connection weights. Consciousness emerges when the system satisfies the condition C(S) = I(S) × R(S) × P(S) > θ, where I(S) is informational integration, R(S) is recursive self-modeling capacity, P(S) is temporal persistence, and θ is a critical threshold. Consciousness is therefore not binary but exists on a continuous spectrum.

4. Computational Implementation
EBESM can be approximated computationally using network-based simulations, non-linear dynamical systems, entropy measures, and information flow metrics. Simulated systems consist of multilayer networks with feedback loops, adaptive weights, and noise-resistant memory traces. Preliminary simulations indicate that consciousness-like informational signatures can emerge in non-biological systems when integration and recursion thresholds are exceeded.

5. Post-Mortem Informational Continuity Hypothesis

5.1 Conceptual Scope
EBESM does not claim the survival of personal identity, memory, or agency after death. Instead, it investigates whether the informational structures underlying consciousness can partially persist following biological system failure. This hypothesis is framed strictly within physical and informational constraints.

5.2 Informational Decay
Biological death leads to rapid neural disintegration and loss of metabolic support. However, informational structures are distributed and may degrade gradually rather than being instantaneously annihilated. EBESM proposes that conscious information possesses a non-zero decay time, during which informational coherence diminishes progressively.

5.3 Physical Constraints
Any post-mortem informational continuity described by EBESM is non-interactive, non-agentic, and incapable of subjective experience as classically defined. The model does not violate thermodynamics, causality, or conservation principles. Post-mortem continuity is treated as informational persistence rather than conscious survival.

6. Experimental and Empirical Implications
EBESM suggests several testable research directions, including artificial consciousness simulations measuring recursive informational coherence, neurodegeneration and near-death analyses examining information collapse, and quantitative studies of informational decay in complex systems. While direct verification of post-mortem continuity is currently infeasible, indirect validation of the model’s principles is achievable.

7. Ethical and Philosophical Implications
By framing consciousness as an informational phenomenon, EBESM challenges anthropocentric assumptions and suggests that artificial systems may eventually warrant moral consideration. Death is reframed not as absolute erasure but as an irreversible transformation of informational organization. EBESM maintains scientific neutrality and does not rely on metaphysical or religious premises.

8. Limitations
Conscious experience remains indirectly measurable, computational models remain approximations, and post-mortem hypotheses remain speculative. EBESM is therefore presented as a research framework rather than a completed theory.

9. Conclusion
The Information-Based Consciousness and Post-Mortem Informational Continuity Model (EBESM) provides a unified, physically consistent approach to understanding consciousness as an emergent informational phenomenon. By decoupling consciousness from strict biological dependency, the model opens new directions for artificial consciousness research and reframes death as an informational transition rather than an absolute endpoint. EBESM offers a coherent theoretical foundation and a roadmap for future computational and empirical investigation.
